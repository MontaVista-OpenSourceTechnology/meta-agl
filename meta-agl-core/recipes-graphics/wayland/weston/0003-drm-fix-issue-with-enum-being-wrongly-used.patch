Subject: [PATCH] drm: fix issue with enum being wrongly used

FAILURE_REASONS_ADD_FB_FAILED is defined as (1 << 3), so when we are
accumulating "failure reasons" in a variable we don't need to do the bit
shift again.

This results in an issue, because (1 << FAILURE_REASONS_ADD_FB_FAILED)
results in (1 << (1 << 3)) == (1 << 8).
